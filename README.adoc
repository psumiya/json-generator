== About Json Generator
This is an experimental project to generate random Json strings based on a given input Json string.

`String generate(String input)`

The method generates a random Json based on the input provided. To see some examples, there are some randomly generated Json strings with corresponding inputs shown in https://github.com/psumiya/json-generator/blob/main/examples.adoc[examples.adoc]

The library takes an opinionated view of what things to randomize and how to go about it.

== Performance

To evaluate performance, a performance benchmark is provided in the `src/jmh` directory.

To execute the benchmark, run `./gradlew jmh` at the root of this project.

Here is the result of a jmh benchmark execution:
